# FAICE

FAICE (Fair Collaboration and Experiments) is a tool suite, helping researchers to work with experiments published in
the FAICE description format. The FAICE software is developed at [CBMI](https://cbmi.htw-berlin.de/)
([HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/) - University of Applied Sciences)

## Install

FAICE is a cross-platform software implemented in Python 3 and can be installed via Python's package manager pip.
Make sure to use the Python 3 version of pip, usually referred to as pip3.

```bash
pip3 install --user faice
```

Also note, that an executable `faice` script will be generated during the installation process. The directory in which
the script resides, must be included in the PATH environment variable.

Run `faice` in a terminal to see if the program can be executed. Otherwise the appropriate directory, which may vary
from platform to platform, must be added manually.

Example directory for windows:

```
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python36\Scripts\
```

Example directory for linux: 

```
~/.local/bin/
```

Instead of altering the PATH environment variable the program can be executed as follows:

```
python3 -m faice
```

### Experiment

FAICE experiments are JSON files, which may contain sensitive information like credentials for data storage or an
execution engine. Instead of publishing an experiment containing these secrets, they should be replaced by variables.
For example `password: "SECRET"` can be replaced with a variable `password: "{{data_password}}"` in double curly braces.
The syntax for variables is borrowed from the Python templating engine Jinja2 and other similar templating engines used
in various programming languages.

## Usage

FAICE provides various tools via a common command line interface. The help commands `faice ${tool} -h`
show additional information about each tool.

```bash
# list available tools
faice
```

```bash
# run the specified experiment in an execution engine
faice run -h
```

```bash
# generate a Vagrantfile to launch the specified execution engine in a virtual machine
faice vagrant -h
```

### Run

The `faice run` tool runs the given experiment by sending the instructions contained in the experiment JSON file to
the specified execution engine.

### Vagrant

The `faice vagrant` tool can be used to set up a local execution engine. When using a local execution
engine, it is not necessary to know any secret credentials for online resources. This local execution engine runs in a
Vagrant virtual machine (VM), where all necessery configuration files are generated by `faice vagrant`.

# FAICE

FAICE (Fair Collaboration and Experiments) is a tool suite, helping researchers to work with experiments published in
the FAICE description format. The FAICE software is developed at [CBMI](https://cbmi.htw-berlin.de/)
([HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/) - University of Applied Sciences)

## Install

FAICE is a cross-platform software implemented in Python 3 and can be installed via Python's package manager pip.
Make sure to use the Python 3 version of pip, usually referred to as pip3.

```bash
pip3 install --user faice
```

Also note, that an executable `faice` script will be generated during the installation process. The directory in which
the script resides, should be included in the `PATH` environment variable.

Run `faice` in a terminal to see if the program can be executed. Otherwise the appropriate directory, which may vary
from platform to platform, must be added manually.

Example directory for Windows:

```
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python36\Scripts\
```

Example directory for Mac:

```
~/Library/Python/3.6/bin/
```

Example directory for Linux: 

```
~/.local/bin/
```

Instead of altering the PATH environment variable the program can be executed as follows:

```
python3 -m faice
```

## Glossary

This glossary explains the basic vocabulary as used by the FAICE tools.

### Execution Engine

An execution engine is able to run programs in a specified manner. The executed programs usually take some input files
and parameters and produce result files. Support for arbitrary execution engines can be implemented in FAICE. Currently
two execution engines, [Curious Containers](https://www.curious-containers.cc/) and
[CWLTool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) (Common Workflow Language), are available.

### Remote Data Storage

A remote data storage provides files, which are downloadable via a network. Common protocols are HTTP and SFTP (SSH).
The access to the resources may be restricted and require authentication.

### Experiment

An experiment is a formal description of a program and how to invoke it with certain input files and parameters.
The experiment description can be redistributed to other researchers or published on a website (e.g. github), such that
results are easily reproducible with the `faice` CLI tools.

FAICE experiments are JSON files, which may contain sensitive information like credentials for remote data storage or an
execution engine. Instead of publishing an experiment containing these secrets, they should be replaced by variables.
For example `password: "SECRET"` can be replaced with a variable `password: "{{data_password}}"` in double curly braces.
The syntax for variables is borrowed from the Python templating engine Jinja2 and other similar templating engines used
in various programming languages.

## Usage

FAICE provides various tools via a common command line interface. The help commands `faice ${tool} -h`
show additional information about each tool.

```bash
# list available tools
faice
```

```bash
# run the specified experiment in an execution engine
faice run -h
```

```bash
# generate a Vagrantfile to launch the specified execution engine in a virtual machine
faice vagrant -h
```

### Run

The `faice run` tool runs the given experiment by sending the instructions contained in the experiment JSON file to
the specified execution engine.

### Vagrant

The `faice vagrant` tool can be used to set up a local execution engine. When using a local execution
engine, it is not necessary to know any secret credentials for online resources. This local execution engine runs in a
Vagrant virtual machine (VM), where all necessery configuration files are generated by `faice vagrant`.

## FAICE Description Format

The basic structure of the format is defined in the jsonschema language as follows:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "format_version": {"enum": ["1"]},
        "execution_engine": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "engine_type": {"enum": ["curious-containers", "common-workflow-language"]},
                "engine_config": {"type": "object"}
            },
            "required": ["engine_type", "engine_config"],
            "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "instructions": {},
        "meta_data": {}
    },
    "required": ["format_version", "execution_engine", "instructions", "meta_data"],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

For example experiments take a look at the
[BDCAT2017 TDS Experiment](https://github.com/somnonetz/bdcat2017-tds-experiment) github repository. The main fields
contained in the JSON document are described below:

### format_version

The `format_version` field exists for future backwards compatibility. For now, the value of this field is always '1'.

### execution_engine

The `execution_engine` field contains an object with `engine_type` and `engine_config` fields, where `engine_type` must
be set to one of the available execution engines. The `engine_config` field gives precise information about the
execution engine itself (like install requirements). The exact content of `engine_config` is defined by engine
integration in the faice software.

### instructions

The `instructions` field contains a technical description of how to run the experiment with the specified execution
engine. This means that `instructions` contains whatever is passed to the execution engine (e.g. a task in JSON format
for Curious Containers).

### meta_data

While the `instructions` field contains a technical description of how to run an experiment, it may lack further
meta_data, which are useful for humans. This `meta_data` complements whatever data is already present in `instructions`
and varies from execution engine to execution engine. Some of the meta data are displayed to the user by the `faice`
CLI tools.
